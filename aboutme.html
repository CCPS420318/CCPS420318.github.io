    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>I am currently working on finding myself and finding God. Once I feel relived from that I would like to focus on making my passion, money. These couple of next years after school I will be taking a break from education and start working a little harder. I want to be important, to the world, the community , family and even friends. Doing things with common sense can take someone really far. </p>
